## Q.1 (A) MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS [4 Marks]

**Instructions:** Choose the correct alternative and write its alphabet.

---

**(1) If ΔABC ~ ΔDEF and ∠A = 48°, then ∠D = ______**

(A) 48°  
(B) 83°  
(C) 49°  
(D) 132°

**Analysis:** From 2022 paper (N 723 Q.1.A.i). Similar triangles have corresponding angles equal. Since A corresponds to D, ∠D = ∠A = 48°. Same pattern in 2020, 2023, 2024, 2025.

---

(B) 6√3 cm  
(C) 6 cm  
(D) 12√3 cm

**Analysis:** From 2022 paper (N 723 Q.1.A.ii). Tangent is perpendicular to radius, so ΔOAP is right-angled at A. sin(30°) = OA/OP = OA/12. OA = 12 × ½ = 6 cm. Same type in 2020, 2024, 2025.

---

**(3) Seg AB is parallel to X-axis and coordinates of point A are (1, 3), then the coordinates of point B can be ______**

(B) (5, 1)  
(C) (3, 0)  
(D) (-5, 3)

**Analysis:** From 2022 paper (N 723 Q.1.A.iii). Line parallel to X-axis has same Y-coordinate. So B must have Y=3. Only option D has Y=3. Same question type in 2021, 2024, 2025.

---

(A) 2  
(B) 1  
(C) 1/2  
(D) 3/4

**Analysis:** From 2022 paper (N 723 Q.1.A.iv). tan 45° = 1, sin 30° = ½. So 2(1) - 2(½) = 2 - 1 = 1. Standard question appearing in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2023, 2024, 2025.

---

---

**(2) Chord AB and chord CD of a circle with centre O are congruent. If m(arc AB) = 120°, then find m(arc CD).**

---

**(3) Find the Y-coordinate of the centroid of a triangle whose vertices are (4, -3), (7, 5) and (-2, 1).**

**Analysis:** From 2022 paper (N 723 Q.1.B.iii). Centroid Y-coordinate = (y₁ + y₂ + y₃)/3 = (-3 + 5 + 1)/3 = 3/3 = 1. Same formula asked in 2020, 2023, 2024, 2025.

---

**(4) If sin θ = cos θ, then what will be the measure of angle θ?**

**Analysis:** From 2022 paper (N 723 Q.1.B.iv). sin θ = cos θ when θ = 45°. Standard question in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2023, 2024, 2025.

## Q.2 (A) COMPLETE THE FOLLOWING ACTIVITIES (ANY TWO) [4 Marks]

### ACTIVITY 1: Similar Triangles (SAS Test)

**Question:** In the above figure, seg AC and seg BD intersect each other in point P. If AP/CP = BP/DP, then complete the following activity to prove ΔABP ~ ΔCDP.

**Activity:**

In ΔAPB and ΔCDP

AP/CP = BP/DP ........ [Given]

∴ ∠APB ≅ ∠CPD ........ [Vertically opposite angles]

∴ ΔAPB ~ ΔCDP ........ [SAS test of similarity]

**Analysis:** From 2022 paper (N 723 Q.2.A.i). Same activity structure in 2020, 2021, 2023, 2024, 2025. Always involves vertically opposite angles + given ratio + SAS similarity.

---

### ACTIVITY 2: Pythagoras Theorem in Rectangle

**Figure:** Rectangle ABCD with diagonal AC.

**Question:** In the above figure, □ABCD is a rectangle. If AB = 5, AC = 13, then complete the following activity to find BC.

**Activity:**

ΔABC is [Right-angled] triangle.

∴ By Pythagoras theorem

AB² + BC² = AC²

∴ 25 + BC² = [169]

∴ BC² = [144]

∴ BC = [12]

**Analysis:** From 2022 paper (N 723 Q.2.A.ii). 5-12-13 Pythagorean triplet. Same activity in 2020, 2023, 2024, 2025. Always fills: type of triangle, AC² value, BC² value, final BC.

---

### ACTIVITY 3: Trigonometric Identity

**Question:** Complete the following activity to prove: cot θ + tan θ = cosec θ × sec θ

**Activity:**

L.H.S. = cot θ + tan θ

= cos θ/sin θ + [sin θ]/cos θ

= [cos²θ] + sin²θ / sin θ × cos θ

= 1/sin θ × cos θ ........ ∵ [sin²θ + cos²θ = 1]

= 1/sin θ × 1/[cos θ]

= [cosec θ] × sec θ

∴ L.H.S. = R.H.S.

**Analysis:** From 2022 paper (N 723 Q.2.A.iii). Same identity proved in 2023 paper. Standard activity structure: convert to sin/cos, take LCM, use identity, convert back.

**(1) If ΔABC ~ ΔPQR, AB : PQ = 4 : 5 and A(ΔPQR) = 125 cm², then find A(ΔABC).**

**Analysis:** From 2022 paper (N 723 Q.2.B.i). Area ratio = (side ratio)² = (4/5)² = 16/25. A(ΔABC)/125 = 16/25 → A(ΔABC) = (16×125)/25 = 16×5 = 80 cm². Same question in 2020, 2021, 2023, 2024, 2025 with different numbers.

---

**Analysis:** From 2022 paper (N 723 Q.2.B.ii). Angle between two secants outside circle = ½(difference of intercepted arcs). ∠DBE = ½[m(arc DXE) - m(arc AYC)] = ½[105° - 47°] = ½ × 58° = 29°. Same theorem in 2020, 2024, 2025.

---

**(3) Draw a circle of radius 3.2 cm and centre 'O'. Take any point P on it. Draw tangent to the circle through point P using the centre of the circle.**

**Analysis:** From 2022 paper (N 723 Q.2.B.iii). Construction: Draw radius OP, construct perpendicular at P. Same construction in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2023, 2024, 2025. Radius varies (3.2cm, 3.4cm, 3.5cm, 4.1cm).

---

**(4) If sin θ = 11/61, then find the value of cos θ using trigonometric identity.**

**Analysis:** From 2022 paper (N 723 Q.2.B.iv). sin²θ + cos²θ = 1 → (11/61)² + cos²θ = 1 → 121/3721 + cos²θ = 1 → cos²θ = 3600/3721 → cos θ = 60/61. Same question in 2020, 2021, 2023, 2024, 2025 with different fractions (7/25, 11/61, etc.).

---

**(5) In ΔABC, AB = 9 cm, BC = 40 cm, AC = 41 cm. State whether ΔABC is a right-angled triangle or not? Write reason.**

**Analysis:** From 2022 paper (N 723 Q.2.B.v). Check: 9² + 40² = 81 + 1600 = 1681 = 41². Yes, right-angled at B (since AB and BC are perpendicular sides). Same question in 2020, 2023, 2024, 2025 with different Pythagorean triplets.

---

## Q.3 (A) COMPLETE THE FOLLOWING ACTIVITIES (ANY ONE) [3 Marks]

### ACTIVITY 1: Intersecting Chords Theorem

**Figure:** Circle with chords PQ and RS intersecting at T.

**Question:** In the above figure, chord PQ and chord RS intersect each other at point T. If ∠STQ = 58° and ∠PSR = 24°, then complete the following activity to verify: ∠STQ = ½[m(arc PR) + m(arc SQ)]

**Activity:**

In ΔPTS,

∠SPQ = ∠STQ - [∠PTS] ∵ Exterior angle theorem

∴ ∠SPQ = 34°

∴ m(arc QS) = 2 × [34]° = 68° ........ ∵ [Inscribed angle theorem]

Similarly m(arc PR) = 2∠PSR = [48]°

∴ ½[m(arc QS) + m(arc PR)] = ½ × [116]° = 58° ........ (I)

but ∠STQ = 58° ........ (II) given

∴ ½[m(arc PR) + m(arc QS)] = [∠STQ] ........ from (I) and (II)

**Analysis:** From 2022 paper (N 723 Q.3.A.i). Same activity in 2024 paper. Structure: exterior angle theorem → find inscribed angle → double it for arc → sum → half → verify.

---

### ACTIVITY 2: Section Formula

**Question:** Complete the following activity to find the coordinates of point P which divides seg AB in the ratio 3 : 1 where A(4, -3) and B(8, 5)

**Activity:**

By section formula,

x = (mx₂ + nx₁)/[m + n], y = [my₂ + ny₁]/(m + n)

∴ x = (3×8 + 1×4)/(3+1), y = (3×5 + 1×(-3))/(3+1)

= [24] + 4 / 4 = [15] - 3 / 4

∴ x = [7] ∴ y = [3]

**Analysis:** From 2022 paper (N 723 Q.3.A.ii). Same activity in 2020, 2023, 2024, 2025. Always internal division, ratio changes (2:3, 3:1, etc.).

---

## Q.3 (B) SOLVE THE FOLLOWING SUB-QUESTIONS (ANY TWO) [6 Marks]

**(1) In ΔABC, seg XY || side AC. If 2AX = 3BX and XY = 9, then find the value of AC.**

**Analysis:** From 2022 paper (N 723 Q.3.B.i). 2AX = 3BX → AX/BX = 3/2 → AX/AB = 3/5. By BPT, XY/AC = BX/BA = 2/5. So 9/AC = 2/5 → AC = 45/2 = 22.5. Same type in 2020, 2021, 2023, 2024, 2025.

---

---

**(4) Show that: (tan A)/(1 + tan²A)² + (cot A)/(1 + cot²A)² = sin A × cos A**

**Analysis:** From 2022 paper (N 723 Q.3.B.iv). Advanced identity. Convert tan to sin/cos, use 1 + tan²A = sec²A. Simplifies to sin A cos A. Same type in 2023, 2024.

---

## Q.4 SOLVE THE FOLLOWING SUB-QUESTIONS (ANY TWO) [8 Marks]

**(1) □ABCD is a parallelogram. Point P is the midpoint of side CD. Seg BP intersects diagonal AC at point X, then prove that: 3AX = 2AC**

**Analysis:** From 2022 paper (N 723 Q.4.i). Uses similarity of triangles. ΔABX ~ ΔCPX (AA test). AB/CP = AX/XC = 2/1. So AX/XC = 2/1 → AX = 2k, XC = k, AC = 3k. Therefore 3AX = 3(2k) = 6k and 2AC = 2(3k) = 6k. Hence 3AX = 2AC. Same type in 2020, 2023, 2024, 2025.

---

---

**(3) Find the coordinates of centroid of a triangle if points D(-7, 6), E(8, 5) and F(2, -2) are the mid-points of the sides of that triangle.**

**Analysis:** From 2022 paper (N 723 Q.4.iii). Advanced coordinate geometry. Centroid of original triangle = centroid of triangle formed by midpoints. So centroid = ((-7+8+2)/3, (6+5-2)/3) = (3/3, 9/3) = (1, 3). Same type in 2020, 2023.

---

**(4) A person is standing at a distance of 50 m from a temple looking at its top. The angle of elevation is of 45°. Find the height of the temple.**

**Analysis:** From 2022 paper (N 723 Q.4.iv). tan 45° = height/50 → 1 = h/50 → h = 50 m. Simple height-distance. Same in 2020, 2023, 2024, 2025 with different angles (30°, 45°, 60°).

---

**Analysis:** From 2022 paper (N 723 Q.5.i). Check: (a²-b²)² + (2ab)² = a⁴ - 2a²b² + b⁴ + 4a²b² = a⁴ + 2a²b² + b⁴ = (a²+b²)². Hence right-angled. Triplets: a=2,b=1 → (3,4,5); a=3,b=2 → (5,12,13). Same in 2020, 2023, 2024, 2025.
